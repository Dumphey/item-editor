Item Editor 2 is an improvement upon the well-known Item Editor plugin that features an all-new GUI system, even more modules, and a refined permission system.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the plugin from Spigot (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/item-editor-2.27637), restart or reload your server and simply put an item in your hand and type `/ie edit`. That's the only command you'll need to edit an item - everything else can be achieved in the Item Editor menu.

## Features

- **Zero configuration**: Just drop the plugin in your `plugins/` directory, reload, and you are good to go.
- **Intuitive editing**: Rename, add lore, enchant, set attributes and item flags, change leather color, create custom potions, and more - all from the same menu.
- **Save items**: You can save (`/ie save`) and retrieve (`/ie get <name>`) any (created) items or give them to your players (`/ie give <player> <item> <amount>`).
- **Placeholders**: Give your players personalized items like '{player_name}'s axe' using [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).
- ... and much more!

## Commands

- `/ie edit` - Edit the item you are holding.
- `/ie reopen` - Reopen the editor of the item you last edited.
- `/ie save <iname>` - Save the item you are holding.
- `/ie delete <iname>` - Delete a saved item.
- `/ie get <iname>` - Give yourself a saved item.
- `/ie give <player> <iname> <amount>` - Give X amount of an item to a player.
- `/ie list` - View a list of saved items.

## Permissions

(A longer description will follow.)

For now, simply give yourself the `ie.*` permission to be able to use all features.
